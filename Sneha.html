    <p> 
      I strongly believe in "A Person", no one else can fit here, only you can. You've been there everytime I neede, may it be editing the write ups, captions, or selecting pictures. I can always count on you for any kind of help.
      YOu are there for me ehen my spirits need a little lfit.
      I cannot thank you enough for that.
      You are truly an extraordinary gift.

      I sometimes feel that I'm not your priority, I want you to know I always kept you and shruti on equal priority, but I don't feel the same because of lot many reasons but I just ignore all that now, because I don't want to waste my college ka bacha hua 1 saal in all this.

      Ik I shouldn't have said all this today but or kabhi me keh hi nhi pati hu, Sorryyy...
      You are the most caring, most suppotive person for whom you think are yours. You are the best of friend anyone could wish for. I am greatful I have you, I will always strive try to live upto your expectations and try to gain that trust, that bond. You truly are a gem.
      It's very rare to have some one like you!!!
      I Love Youuu and will Forever keep loving <3
